  title: Orthodoxy & Technology
  description: >
    Technology is all around us. We use it at school, for work, to communicate
    with friends and family, and so many other things. But are we using it
    responsibly? Does technology have any implications on our faith?

  We live in a world where we are surrounded by things that can either help us
  in our walk with Christ or create stumbling blocks in our Christian journey.
  The Youth & Techology Taskforce was commissioned by His Grace, Bishop +BASIL
  to pull together clergy, youth workers, and young people from our diocese to
  look at how technology exists in our lives, how we can create safeguards, and
  how we can use it to help us grow in and share our faith. Here you'll find
  resources to help with issues like:

        Cyber Bullying. Bullying has always been an issue young people face. In
        our current digital age, the reach of bullying has expanded, bringing
        bullies to school, home, church, and everywhere else victims go.

        We believe that good coffee has the power to bring people together.
        That’s why we decided to turn a corner of our shop into a cozy meeting
        space where you can hang out with fellow coffee lovers and learn about
        coffee making techniques. All of the artwork on display there is for
        sale. The full price you pay goes to the artist.
