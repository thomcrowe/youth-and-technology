  title: Orthodoxy & Technology
  description: >
    Technology is all around us. We use it at school, for work, to communicate
    with friends and family, and so many other things. But are we using it
    responsibly? Does technology have any implications on our faith?

  We live in a world where we are surrounded by things that can either help us
  in our walk with Christ or create stumbling blocks in our Christian journey.
  The Youth & Techology Taskforce was commissioned by His Grace, Bishop +BASIL
  to pull together clergy, youth workers, and young people from our diocese to
  look at how technology exists in our lives, how we can create safeguards, and
  how we can use it to help us grow in and share our faith. Here you'll find
  resources to help with issues like:

        Social media helps connect us to our loved ones, keep in touch with
        friends, and share our joys. It can also be a dangerous place to
        navigate and keep a healthy relatsionship with.

        With the world at our fingertips at all times, it's hard to avoid
        becoming addicted. Games, social media, texting, and some unsavory sides
        of the internet build obstacles to our spiritual life by becoming
        addictions that we can't walk away from.
