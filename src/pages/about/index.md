### It started with a commision

Earlier this year, His Grace Bishop +BASIL tasked Fr. Daniel with creating a task force to look at technology and how it affects our youth. The need for the task force is great, and the team started working on creating a mission, gaining a focus, and moving forward. 

### The Mission

The mission of the Task Force on Youth and Technology is to provide resources and education for parishes, youth workers, parents, and young people on the risks involved with technology, how to safely use technology, warning signs of risky behaviors, and positive ways to engage with technology to grow in and share our faith.
